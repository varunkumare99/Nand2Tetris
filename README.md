## Project 4
The following programs were implemented in HACK assembly:
1. Mult.asm - Multiplication: in the Hack computer, the top 16 RAM words (RAM[0]...RAM[15]) are also referred to as R0...R15. 
This program computes the value R0*R1 and stores the result in R2
2. Fill.asm - I/O handling: this program illustrates low-level handling of the screen and keyboard devices, as follows. The program runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input. When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen, i.e. writes "black" in every pixel; the screen should remain fully black as long as the key is pressed.When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen, i.e. writes "white" in every pixel; the screen should remain fully clear as long as no key is pressed.
